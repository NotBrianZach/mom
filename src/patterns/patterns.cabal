Synopsis:        Common patterns in message-oriented applications
Description:

  There are common patterns often reused 
  - or, in fact, reimplemented,
  in many message-oriented applications,
  such as Server/Client (a.k.a Request/Response),
         Publish/Subscribe,
         Pipline (a.k.a. Push/Pull) and
         Exclusive Pair (a.k.a. Peer-to-Peer).
  The Patterns package implements those patterns 
  using the /zeromq/ library without using centralised brokers.

  More information, examples and a test suite are available 
  on <http://github.com/toschoo/stompl>.
  More information about zeromq can be found at
